            ConfigExamples
            --------------

The files in this directory are used by LaTeX to create a PDF
file containing the NUT Configuration Examples document.

The base document is a LaTeX markup ConfigExamples.tex with two 
specific style files lineprinter.sty, and wrapfig.sty which although
featuring in the LaTeX Companion, now seems to be deprecated,
so I provide a copy.

By default the PDF is created for the A5 page size, more suitable 
for reading on-screen.

The .fig figures were created using the venerable xfig, and
exported as .pdf by xfig for inclusion in the final document.

To build the document:

   make clean && make

Latex will be run three times to ensure that all labels are 
correctly referenced.  The output is in file ConfigExamples.pdf.

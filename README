            ConfigExamples
            --------------
The files in this directory provide for the creation of a PDF
file containing the NUT Configuration Examples document.

The base document is a LaTeX markup ConfigExamples.tex with two 
specific style files lineprinter.sty, and wrapfig.sty which although
featuring in the LaTeX Companion, now seems to be deprecated,
so I provide a copy.

The .fig figures were created using the venerable xfig, and
exported as .pdf for inclusion in the final document.

To build the document:

   make clean && make

Latex will be run three times to ensure that all labels are 
correctly referenced.
